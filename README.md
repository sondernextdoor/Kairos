# Kairos – Advanced PatchGuard & Secure Kernel Evasion Framework

**Kairos** is a next-generation, red-team-oriented Windows kernel defense neutralization framework.  
It combines traditional runtime patching with UEFI persistence, hypervisor-level surveillance, and Secure Kernel deception.

Kairos—being fully AI generated—is a public display of cutting-edge AI prompt engineering and novelty.

## Features

### PatchGuard & HVCI Bypass
- [x] Encrypted patch vault with just-in-time patching
- [x] DPC, timer, and worker-thread PatchGuard context discovery
- [x] Stack fingerprint engine (signatureless PG detection)
- [x] Hardware breakpoints on PG routines
- [x] EPT-based traps via custom hypervisor

### Secure Kernel & VTL1 Deception
- [x] SkciValidateImage hook (spoofs validation results)
- [x] SkDispatchCall inline hook (blocks VTL1 actions)
- [x] SkciReportIntegrityFailure suppression
- [x] BitLocker & VBS PCR spoofing (TPM/Pluton)
- [x] VTL1 telemetry redirection via stack hash

### Hypervisor (Kairos-HV)
- [x] VT-x + EPT identity map
- [x] EPT execution trap + context injection
- [x] Multi-core VMX launcher
- [x] Live guest stack trace fingerprinting

### UEFI Bootkit (DXE Payload)
- [x] DXE-stage EFI loader stub
- [x] winload.efi memory patcher
- [x] VSMEnable EFI variable patch
- [x] Boot-chain to inject Kairos into kernel space

### Loader
- [x] Manual PE injector (in-memory load of Kairos++)
- [x] Stealth driver cloak (unlinked, header wiped)
- [x] No use of IoCreateDriver, MmGetSystemRoutineAddress, or visible handles

## Architecture Overview

```plaintext
[ UEFI DXE Stage ]
    └─ Bootkit → Patches VSMEnable, winload.efi, loads HV stub

[ Hypervisor (VMX) ]
    └─ Traps EPT access → Injects trap handler or reverts patch

[ VTL0 (Windows Kernel) ]
    └─ Kairos++ manually mapped
          ├─ Encrypted patch vault
          ├─ Stack + DPC + Timer PG detection
          └─ Skci / CI / BitLocker spoofing

[ VTL1 (Secure Kernel) ]
    └─ Fooled via fake SkDispatch responses + attestation override
